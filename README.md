Summary
-------------

It is the teaching material for the workshop at KDI. I attended the workshop as a instructor to explain semantic network analysis and elementary instructions of R. It seemed impossible for me to teach senior professors who haven't learned syntax-based statistical tools as well as programming language. Anyway, I did my best to provide the best teaching material for a bigginer.

In the workshop, I suggested two toy datasets for the participants. In the 'Data' folder, there are sample english and korean text data. I used the R Markdown files to teach R. The 'beginnersR.rmd' file covers basic file types and instructions of R, and 'preprocess.rmd' file suggests the way how to manage and clean external text file and string data. 

After that, 'network.rmd' file explains a basic instructions for the package which can be used to make co-occurrence matrix, and simple code to transform the co-occurrence matrix data into network type data. At the end of the file, I explained a method to extract network property and save the graph data into .graphml format. 

Furthermore, based on the .graphml file, I showed some techniques on visualization using Gephi. 

Additionally, the file 'korean.rmd' explains the 'KoNLP' package for korean morpheme analysis and how to apply it to the methods that I explained in the 'network.rmd' file.

Of course, the teaching scheme that I planned was failed. Participants had a difficulty time to the new programming language. But some attendees have succeeded in learning R and are still using it on their research.
